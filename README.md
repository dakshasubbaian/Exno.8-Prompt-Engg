## Aim:
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
## Algorithm: 

1. Select a suitable AI audio generation model (e.g., OpenAI TTS, Meta MusicGen, Google AudioLM).

2. Decide the category of audio output required (music, sound effect, or narration).

3. Formulate prompts with different levels of detail, tone, and style.

4. Feed the prompts into the AI audio model for processing.

5. Adjust parameters such as instrument, mood, pitch, duration, or voice type.

6. Save and analyze the generated audio files.

7. Compare results to study the effect of prompt variations on output quality.

## Sample Prompt–Output Table
| No. | Prompt Used                                                 | Target Audio    | Model      | Output Summary                     |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1   | “Generate a calm piano melody for 15 seconds”               | Relaxing music  | MusicGen   | Soft piano tune with steady rhythm |
| 2   | “Create a thunderstorm sound effect”                        | Realistic SFX   | AudioLM    | Thunder with background rain       |
| 3   | “Speak ‘Welcome to AI Audio Lab’ in a female robotic voice” | Voice narration | OpenAI TTS | Clear robotic female narration     |
| 4   | “Make a 12-second fast-paced techno beat”                   | Music loop      | MusicGen   | Energetic electronic rhythm        |

## Observations
| Prompt Variation     | Parameter Changed                | Change in Output                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Instrument specified | From “melody” to “guitar melody” | Focused on guitar sounds        |
| Mood altered         | From “calm” to “happy”           | Higher tempo and cheerful notes |
| Voice type changed   | Male vs. Female                  | Narration tone varied           |
| Duration modified    | 12s vs. 25s                      | Output extended accordingly     |

## Result: 

The Prompt for the above process executed successfully
